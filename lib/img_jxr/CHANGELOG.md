## [Unreleased]

## [0.2.0] - 2026-11-14

### Security

- Files with an index table get the same plausibility check as those without (at least one bit
  per macroblock and plane in the data): a file of 86 bytes that claims 16384 x 16384 pixels
  fails with `ERR_TRUNC` right after its headers instead of after allocating up to 8.5 GB.
